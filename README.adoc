This guide walks you through the process of executing a Spring Batch job on Hadoop YARN.

== What you'll build

You'll build a simple Hadoop YARN application with Spring Hadoop,
Spring Batch and Spring Boot.

== What you'll need

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/prereq_editor_jdk_buildtools.adoc[]
 - Local single-node instance based on Hadoop 2.2.0 or later

NOTE: Testing this sample application doesn't need existing or running Hadoop instance.

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/how_to_complete_this_guide.adoc[]

[[scratch]]
== Set up the project

First you set up a basic build script. You can use any build system you like when building apps with Spring, but the code you need to work with http://gradle.org[Gradle] is included here. If you're not familiar with it, refer to link:/guides/gs/gradle[Building Java Projects with Gradle].

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/create_directory_structure_yarn_test_hello.adoc[]

=== Create a Gradle build file
Below is the https://github.com/spring-guides/{project_id}/blob/master/initial/build.gradle[initial Gradle build file]. If you are using link:/guides/gs/sts[Spring Tool Suite (STS)], you can import the guide directly.

`build.gradle`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/build.gradle[]
----

In above gradle build file we simply create three different jars, each having classes for its specific role. These jars are then repackaged by Spring Boot's gradle plugin to create an executable jars.

You also need a `settings.gradle` file to define the sub-projects.

`settings.gradle`

== Spring Batch Intro

Many batch processing problems can be solved with single threaded,
single process jobs, so it is always a good idea to properly check if
that meets your needs before thinking about more complex
implementations. When you are ready to start implementing a job with
some parallel processing, Spring Batch offers a range of options. At a
high level there are two modes of parallel processing: single process,
multi-threaded; and multi-process.

Spring Hadoop contains a support for running Spring Batch jobs using
YARN on a on a Hadoop cluster. For better parallel processing Spring Batch
partitioned steps can be executed on YARN as remote steps.

The starting point for running a Spring Batch Job on YARN is always the
Application Master whether the job is just a simple job with or without
partitioning. In the case when partitioning is not used, the whole job would
run within the Application Master and no additional YARN containers would be
launched. This may seem a bit odd, to run something on YARN without using
containers, but one should remember that the Application Master is also just a
resource allocated from the Hadoop cluster running in a YARN container.

In order to run Spring Batch jobs on a Hadoop cluster, few constraints
exists:

- `Job Context` - Application Master is the main entry point of running
the job.
- `Job Repository` - Application Master needs to have access to a
repository which is located either in-memory or in a relational database.
These are the two types natively supported by Spring Batch.
- `Remote Steps` - Due to nature how Spring Batch partitioning works,
remote steps need access to the job repository.

Let's take a quick look at how Spring Batch partitioning is handled.
The concept of running a partitioned job involves three things, Remote
Steps, Partition Handler and a Partitioner. If we do a little bit of
oversimplification a remote step is like any other step from a user
point of view. Spring Batch itself does not contain implementations
for any proprietary grid or remoting fabrics. Spring Batch does
however provide a useful implementation of PartitionHandler that
executes Steps locally in separate threads of execution, using the
TaskExecutor strategy from Spring. Spring Hadoop provides
implementation to execute Steps remotely on a Hadoop cluster using YARN.

NOTE: For more background information about the Spring Batch
Partitioning, read the Spring Batch reference documentation.

== Create a Remote Batch Step

Here you create a `PrintTasklet` class.

`gs-yarn-batch-processing-container/src/main/java/hello/container/PrintTasklet.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/gs-yarn-batch-processing-container/src/main/java/hello/container/PrintTasklet.java[]
----

A `Tasklet` in Spring Batch is one of the easiest concepts to use when
something needs to be executed in a step as part of a job.
This simple tasklet is serving the purpose of demonstrating how simple it is to execute
a real `Partitioned Step`s on Hadoop YARN without introducing more
complex job processing.

In the above `PrintTasklet` we simply write a log message when the `Tasklet`
itself is executed.

Now it's time to create a `ContainerApplication` class.

`gs-yarn-batch-processing-container/src/main/java/hello/container/ContainerApplication.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/gs-yarn-batch-processing-container/src/main/java/hello/container/ContainerApplication.java[]
----

- The `@EnableYarnRemoteBatchProcessing` annotation tells Spring to enable
  Batch processing for YARN Containers. Batch `@EnableBatchProcessing` is
  then automatically included which means all builders for JavaConfig are
  available.
- We `@AutoWired` the step builder which is then used to create steps as
  beans.
- We define `PrintTasklet` as a `@Bean`
- We create a step as a `@Bean` and instruct it to execute a tasklet.

Next we create an `application.yml` file for the container.

`gs-yarn-batch-processing-container/src/main/resources/application.yml`
[source,yaml]
----
include::complete/gs-yarn-batch-processing-container/src/main/resources/application.yml[]
----

- We disable batch functionality in Spring Boot core to use YARN specific features.
- We add Hadoop configuration for HDFS. This can be customized for accessing a real cluster.
- We enable batch processing on YARN by using
  `spring.yarn.batch.enabled` property.

== Create a Batch Job

Here we create a `AppmasterApplication` class.

`gs-yarn-batch-processing-appmaster/src/main/java/hello/appmaster/AppmasterApplication.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/gs-yarn-batch-processing-appmaster/src/main/java/hello/appmaster/AppmasterApplication.java[]
----

- `@EnableYarnBatchProcessing` tells Spring to enable Batch processing
  for appmaster.
- We `@AutoWired` builders for steps and jobs.

Next we create an `application.yml` file for the appmaster.

`gs-yarn-batch-processing-appmaster/src/main/resources/application.yml`
[source,yaml]
----
include::complete/gs-yarn-batch-processing-appmaster/src/main/resources/application.yml[]
----

- We disable batch functionality in Boot core to use a YARN specific featurs.
- We add Hadoop configuration for HDFS. This can be customized for accessing a real cluster.
- We enable batch processing on YARN by using
  `spring.yarn.batch.enabled` property.
- We define a job named `job` to run automatically.
- We enable a job named `job` and allow it to do a next operation.

== Create a Yarn Client

Here we create a `ClientApplication` class.

`gs-yarn-batch-processing-client/src/main/java/hello/client/ClientApplication.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/gs-yarn-batch-processing-client/src/main/java/hello/client/ClientApplication.java[]
----

The `ClientApplication` is similar to what we've used in other guides and
its only purpose is to submit a YARN application.

Here you create an `application.yml` file for the client.

`gs-yarn-batch-processing-client/src/main/resources/application.yml`
[source,yaml]
----
include::complete/gs-yarn-batch-processing-client/src/main/resources/application.yml[]
----

- Here we simply defined all the files of the application that are needed
  for submission.

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/build_yarn_application.adoc[]

== Run the Application

Now that we've successfully compiled and packaged our application,
it's time to do the fun part and execute it on Hadoop YARN.

Simply run the executable client jar.

[source]
----
$ cd gs-yarn-batch-processing-dist
$ java -jar target/gs-yarn-batch-processing-dist/gs-yarn-batch-processing-client-0.1.0.jar
----

If the application executes successfully we should be able to see two steps executed on a YARN.

== Create a JUnit Test Class

Below is a class which can be used to execute this application as a
JUnit test without running Hadoop cluster.

`gs-yarn-batch-processing-dist/src/test/java/hello/AppIT.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/gs-yarn-batch-processing-dist/src/test/java/hello/AppIT.java[]
----

== Summary

Congratulations! You've just developed a Spring YARN application
executing a Spring Batch job!
